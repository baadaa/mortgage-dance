      "meaning": "What the lender charges the borrower for making the mortgage loan. The origination fee may include processing the application, underwriting and funding the loan, and other administrative services. Origination fees generally can only increase under certain circumstances.<br /><br />The VA allows lenders to charge borrowers a flat fee of up to 1 percent of the loan amount to cover in-house costs and services, such as originating, processing and underwriting the loan. A 1 percent fee on a $250,000 loan is $2,500. Lenders also have the option to skip the flat fee and charge an array of fees to cover overhead, so long as their total cost doesn't exceed 1 percent of the loan amount.<br /><br />VA buyers can ask sellers to pay all of their loan-related closing costs (including the origination fee) and up to 4 percent in concessions, which can cover things like prepaid taxes and insurance and much more."

      "meaning": "When selling an item offers within a reasonable price range will be considered. However, the highest offer will supersede all others.
