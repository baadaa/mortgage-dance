      "term": "Zero Money Down",
      "meaning": "A type of loan where the borrower isn't required to pay a down payment. The VA Loan is one of the two remaining major loan programs that offer the advantage of no money down. Conventional loans typically require a 5 percent down payment, with FHA loans requiring a minimum 3.5 percent.<br /><br />Despite the zero-down benefit, VA loans have had the lowest foreclosure rate on the market for most of the last decade. That's a testament to the program's sound underwriting guidelines and its commitment to helping veterans purchase and keep their homes."
