      "term": "Jumbo Loan",
      "meaning": "Generally, these are loans above what's known as the conforming loan limit. Jumbo VA loans typically feature tighter requirements than a traditional VA loan, but they still offer some tremendous benefits compared to conventional jumbo loans.<br /><br />Some jumbo VA loans can be had without a down payment, while others will require oneâ€”every buyer's situation is different. But even buyers who need to put money down often need smaller down payments for jumbo VA loans compared to their conventional counterparts."
