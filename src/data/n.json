If the home's appraised value comes in below the purchase price, buyers will need to renegotiate with the seller or walk away from the deal. Renegotiation is common, but veterans who walk away will get their earnest money back because of what's known as the VA Amendment to Contract, which protects buyers in the event of a low appraisal."
